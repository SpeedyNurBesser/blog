Every few months / years / weeks I think of my past self of being not necessarily embarrassing, but wrong for sure.<!--more--> At some point, my personality, and his personality have diverged to a point, where we can no longer be considered equals anymore. {% sidenote '1' "Thus, it's no wonder, I'm so bad at keeping my old stuff online. "%}

I don't think of this being the case as a problem by necessity. I think, it just shows that I — like everyone — keep learning and am thus forced to again and again change my opinions and my thinking, which I think is rather advantageous.

This way of being is just not easy. Really, it's rather hard to keep challenging your current beliefs. It would definitely be easier to fall for some kind of set out rule book, claiming to explain how the world works, be it religion or some other non-changing worldview. I'm not even certain that I will always be certain that a life of constant uncertainty is right.

But I couldn't imagine living another way. Believing something stubbornly, although there is better information available, seems to me like suicide in the sense of love to knowledge. That might be what French philosopher Albert Camus meant, when he explained philosophical{% sidenote '2' "Philosophy consists of the two Ancient Greek words [philo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1) (love) and [sophia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%AF%CE%B1) (wisdom or knowledge). It thus means 'love of wisdom'"%} suicide. 

I don't know what time will bring and how my opinions will change, but my current self hopes that I will keep this basic principle.
