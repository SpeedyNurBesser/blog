Hey there, good to see you.

I'm testing stuff right here.

Did you realize that I can add footnotes here {% sidenote 'banana' "Like right here to the side (unless your on a small screen like a phone, where it's displayed directly beneath the text, but only, when the foot(side-)note was clicked upon.)"%}, but there at the side of the page! (Note, that there aren't called footnotes, but sidenotes, which I like even better, for it feels more natural to me to say: *Let me just add a quick sidenote here.*)

This is possible, as I'm using a theme for Jekyll{% sidenote 'onJekyll' "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static side generator I use for generating this blog and hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)."%} called [Tufte-Jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) which uses the famed style of designer Edward Tufte.

{% newthought "Isn't this cool‽" %} [does the Interrobang render correctly everywhere? (it should, as it is a regular unicode symbol)]

**P.S.**

I can even embed images on the side. {% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/marginFigureTest1.png' '*An image*, I made it myself.'  %}










**P.P.S.** *(edit: 9th Nov 2024)* 

You can now write comments down here. Assuming everything works out fine at least...

Though it should be noted that you need a GitHub account to comment, as I'm using [giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments, which uses the [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) feature to store comments.

This feature was initially planed, but I just kinda forgot about adding comments. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
